# Hotel-Revenue-Dashboard

##**Background**

This project explores a hotel revenue dataset spanning across three years (2018, 2019, and 2020). SQL and Power BI were leveraged to uncover valuable insights about revenue & guest seasonality.

Data from raw .csv file was ingested into SQL Server Management Studio [SSMS], from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final SQL output which was then imported into SSMS for data analysis & visualization. Additional data processing was done in PowerBI with PowerQuery M for visualization purposes. Guests, revenue seasonality, recommendation for staffing arrangement, and dataset limitations were explained in the accompanying PowerPoint slide with the help of PowerBI visualizations.
